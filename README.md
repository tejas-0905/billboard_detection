## 🔎 Overview  
Illegal and non-compliant billboards clutter cities, cause safety issues, and violate regulations.  
Our solution allows citizens and authorities to:  
- Detect unauthorized billboards in **real-time**.  
- Report them with **geo-tagged evidence**.  
- Track and analyze **violation hotspots** for better urban planning.  

---

## 🚀 Features  

- 📸 **Image & Video Input** – Capture from camera or upload existing image/video.  
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Detection** – Detect unauthorized billboards using trained YOLO/TensorFlow models.  
- 📊 **Real-Time Results** – Get instant feedback with detection highlights.  
- 🌐 **User-Friendly Interface** – Modern, responsive web app UI.  
- 🔗 **Firebase Integration** – Stores user submissions and updates points in profile.  
- 📢 **Citizen Engagement** – Users can report violations and contribute to cleaner cities.  
- 🗺️ **Geo-Tagging Support** – Each report is linked with location for verification.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

| **Category**     | **Technology Used** |
|------------------|--------------------|
| **Frontend**     | HTML, CSS, JavaScript |
| **Backend**      | Flask / Node.js |
| **AI/ML**        | OpenCV, TensorFlow / YOLOv5 |
| **Database**     | Firebase (Realtime DB / Firestore) |
| **Hosting**      | Netlify (frontend), Heroku/Render (backend) |

## ⚙️ Workflow  

1. **User uploads** an image/video or captures via camera.  
2. **AI model processes** the input using YOLO/TensorFlow and highlights billboard regions.  
3. **System checks compliance** (registered vs. unauthorized).  
4. **Firebase logs report** with user profile & geo-coordinates.  
5. **Authorities dashboard** (future scope) can verify and take action.
